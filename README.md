# Flight Ticket Booking
This is my CSE311 project where I built a website.

### Features
1. **Login Page:** 
   - Users must log in with their email and password to access the website. Access is restricted without proper login credentials.

2. **Register Page:** 
   - Users can create their profiles here to gain access to the website. Registration is restricted to one unique email per user.

3. **User Portal:** 
   - Users can view available flights and make flight reservations within the user portal. Users are also allowed to book multiple flights simultaneously.

4. **Admin Portal:** 
   - Reserved for department members with administrative privileges, the admin portal provides access to information about the number of users who have made flight bookings. Administrators can also create flights, airports, and airlines.
